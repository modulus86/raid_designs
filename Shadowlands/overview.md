  * External System / Storyline changes
    * Story diffs:
      * You get pulled into the Shadowlands but don't get pulled into the Maw initially, rather you find yourself in Bastion
      * You learn about the Anima drought and the Maw sworn
      * Afterwards you go to Oribos to learn more about where you are
      * Story roughly continues as normal, except that the Jailor isn't specifically mentioned also the attendants of Oribos aren't exactly nice to you, only the Etherals/Brokers seem to treat you with respect.
    * As you progress you get the powers of each covenant as continue through the story, however you can only "embody" one covenant at a time
    * After finishing the story line you gain the ability to choose which covenant you want to embody at any given time but can freely switch
    * Soulbinds are introduced through the covenant storys
      * At max level you unlock more soulbind "rows" by leveling them up as you would a normal player. This can be accomplished through all forms of game play.
    * Renown is now your overall representation of how well known you are in the Shadowlands - unlocking cosmetics as you go
