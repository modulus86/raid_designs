# Overview

This is a thought / design experiment to see how a different way end game in Shadowlands could have played out. This leans more on the raiding side of things, though hopefully some of the other system changes proposed will counter that.

# Quick Summary

* 4 raids with 5 bosses each in each Covenant Zone
  * two raids per major patch (9.0, 9.1)
* 2 10 person raids on 3 day lock outs
  * one mini raid per .5 patch (9.0.5, 9.1.5)
* 1 large end of expansion raid
  * final 9.2.0 raid

  * Defend the Heart of the Forest
  * tied with the Dragons of Nightmare from Vanilla / Emerald Nightmare
  * Final Boss is Gorak Tul

* Revendreth
  * Shorted Castle Nathria raid
  * Shriekwing, Council of Blood, Sludgefist, Stone Legion Generals, Sire Denathrius
  * final boss is Sire Denathrius still
  * Serves as the Cap Stone for the 4 Covenant raids

* Maldraxxus
  * Green Naxx Themed raid
  * Two flying Ziggurates fighting
  * Kel'thuzad is the final boss
  * Two bosses on the friendly ziggurate, three on the enemgy Ziggurate

* Bastion
  * Maw-sworn vs the Paragons
  * Uther is a boss
  * Devos is the final boss (either escapes at the end of, or another boss replaces, Spires of Ascension)

## Mini raids

* Small 3 boss raids in Revendreth and The Maw
* 3 day lockout timer
* Designed for 10 people on roughly Heroic difficulty
* Drop unique equip gems for fun bonuses (2 per boss)
* Final boss drops system upgrade items (Conduits)
* Designed to be run in about 45 minutes
* NOT Part of LFR

* Revendreth
  * Castle Nathria Sewers
  * Fight Huntsman, Hungering Destoryer, Artificer Xy'Mox

* The Maw
  * 3 day rotation (rotation on reset) of 9 bosses
  * More powerful versions of rares in The Maw

### Unique Gem Loot

The idea behind these raids is not to provide specific gear, but to provide gems that augment gear in a slightly more difficult way than just a dungeon. Some ideas around what they could be:
* Class specific gem:
  * Priest: Shadow Word Pain's duration is extended by 6 seconds
  * Warrior: Ignore Pain's damage redirection is increased by 5%
  * Death Knight: Every 3rd Death Strike the resulting Blood Shield is doubled

## Maw Raid

* Assault the front gates of Torghast
* 10 bosses
* Domination Resist Gear to help progression through the raid
* Sylvannas is the penultimate boss
  * Fight revolves around her trying to convince Anduin to join her side
  * You don't kill her....
* The Jailor is the final boss

### Domination Resists

Gear that drops with The Maw raid will have `Domination Resistance` on it. This allows you to reduce or partially ignore certain mechanics within the raid, the more of this resistance you have the higher your changes you will resist an ability. At a certain level of resist you negate all of the effects entirely (roughly 8 pieces of gear).

# External System / Storyline changes
  * Story diffs:
    * You get pulled into the Shadowlands but don't get pulled into the Maw initially, rather you find yourself in Bastion
    * You learn about the Anima drought and the Maw sworn
    * Afterwards you go to Oribos to learn more about where you are
    * Story roughly continues as normal, except that the Jailor isn't specifically mentioned also the attendants of Oribos aren't exactly nice to you, only the Etherals/Brokers seem to treat you with respect.
  * As you progress you get the powers of each covenant as continue through the story, however you can only "embody" one covenant at a time
  * After finishing the story line you gain the ability to choose which covenant you want to embody at any given time but can freely switch
  * Soulbinds are introduced through the covenant story's
    * At max level you unlock more soulbind "rows" by leveling them up as you would a normal player. This can be accomplished through all forms of game play and is not capped.
  * Renown is now your overall representation of how well known you are in the Shadowlands - unlocking cosmetics as you go
